I have had almost no experience with html.  I managed a website briefly but only changed the text and image content.  I have used javascript one time.

I use Firefox regularly and like their stance on privacy and collecting information.  I also like the Google Chrome incognito setting which lets you use multiple accounts and prevent sites from counting how many times I have visited.
